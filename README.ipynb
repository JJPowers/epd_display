    "    - `$ wget https://github.com/txoof/epd_display/raw/master/paperpi_latest.tgz`\n",

    "3. Launch PaperPi: `$ ./paperpi/dist/paperpi`\n",
    "    - On the first run PaperPi will create a configuration file in `~/.config/com.txoof.paperpi/paperpi.ini` and then exit\n",

    "    - `$ nano ~/.config/com.txoof.paperpi/paperpi.ini`\n",
    "        - At minimum you must specify the `display_type`\n",
    "        - If you are using an HD IT8951 display, you must also set the `vcom` value which can be found on the ribon cable.\n",

    "        - See the list of [supported screens](#supportedScreens) for more information\n",
    "5. Launch PaperPi again -- you should immediately see a splash screen followed shortly by the first active plugin.\n",
    "6. Press `ctrl+c` to shutdown paperpi cleanly\n",
    "    - Waveshare recommends clearing pannels to a blank state prior to long-term storage\n",

    "        * add a configuration file to `/etc/defaults/paperpi.ini`\n",
